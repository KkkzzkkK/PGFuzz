# PGFUZZ

PGFUZZ is a policy-guided fuzzing framework. You can freely use it to define and find more bugs. By specifying a metric temporal logic (MTL) formula, PGFUZZ is able to mutate inputs related to the formula and to discover more interesting bug cases. Many of the ideas behind PGFUZZ are documented in a Paper published at NDSS 2021.
